Meta-Learning with One-Shot Positive and Negative Bags of Examples for Feeding Splash Segmentation (The 37th IPPR Conference on CVGIP, 2024)

In aquaculture, automatic feeding systems are often adopted to reduce operational costs. These systems must assess the appetite of fish because surplus feed is wasted and can pollute the water and cause fish diseases.The appetite of certain fish species can be indirectly analyzed from splashes created when they grab feed. The pattern and coverage of these feeding splashes are various and related to many factors, such as aquaculture environ ments and fish conditions. To adapt to various envi ronments, a meta-learning approach is proposed to de tect feeding splashes. The proposed detector is a multitask semantic segmentation network with multiple out put branches, each aimed at feeding splash segmentation for a specific kind of aquaculture environments. A task-clustering strategy is proposed to automatically determine the number of branches and the assignment of environments to branches. The proposed approach uses contrastive learning with one-shot positive and negative bags of examples to combine the output branches without human labeling. The proposed approach has been tested against data collected from several aquaculture environments, and experimental results have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach.
